# task

I have used jQuery to first make an AJAX call to the given url.
Then i have parsed the data received through the api and appened the required informantion to the DOM.
And finally i used JSON functions to provide the desired output in the desired format.

I have taken the help of BOOTSTRAP to make the webpage look better.
